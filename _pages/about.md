I'm a graduate student at Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Alexey Tumanov](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~atumanov/) at the Systems for Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL)

In the past, I was a Research Fellow & Machine Learning Scientist at the [Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence](http://wadhwaniai.org/) where I primarily worked on [estimating newborn anthropometry](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/programs/newborn-anthropometry/) using monocular video. I also played a pivotal role in drafing data privacy guidelines, best practices, and helping establish ML infrastructure.

My work has been featured in [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/03/26/1201/how-artificial-intelligence-is-helping-farmers-and-babies-in-the-developing-world/), and has been the recipient of [Fast Company's World Changing Idea](https://www.fastcompany.com/90626533/this-ai-powered-tech-calculates-a-babys-weight-just-from-a-video) award in 2021

In a previous life, as an undergraduate student at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), I worked on distributed algorithms, specifically on scaling clustering algorithms to [billion scale data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8891020)

<font size=2><b>Note</b>: My full legal name is "S... Aditya Sarma, Annavajjala" (Given Name, Last Name). My last name in my undergrad was incorrectly noted as Sarma so my prior publications (2019 and earlier) have my name as "Aditya Sarma". <br>
My preferred formal name is "Aditya Annavajjala" while informally I go by "Aditya AS" or just "AS"</font>
