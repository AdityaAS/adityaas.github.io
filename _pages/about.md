I am an AI researcher with experience in Computer Vision and ML Systems. I am interested in robust and efficient representation learning.

Previously, I was a MS thesis student at Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Alexey Tumanov](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~atumanov/) at the [Systems for Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL)](https://gatech-sysml.github.io/). I worked on efficient training of large neural networks to enable cost effective deployment across diverse scenarios.

In the past, I was a Research Fellow & Machine Learning Scientist at the [Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence](http://wadhwaniai.org/) where I worked on [estimating newborn anthropometry](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/programs/newborn-anthropometry/) using monocular video. I developed our data pipelines, internal training framework, and applied research for 3D reconstruction (RGB -> 3D). I developed processes and coordinated cross functional efforts across 3 teams.


I am honoured to be a young researcher at [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/about-us.html) 2023. My work has previously been featured in [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/03/26/1201/how-artificial-intelligence-is-helping-farmers-and-babies-in-the-developing-world/). My work has also been the recipient of grants from the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) and won [Fast Company's World Changing Idea](https://www.fastcompany.com/90626533/this-ai-powered-tech-calculates-a-babys-weight-just-from-a-video) award in 2021

At Georgia Tech and BITS Pilani, I also frequently donned the role of a SysAdmin helping with cluster configurations, internal tooling, and low level linux diagnostics. [Here](https://adityaas.notion.site/SysAdmin-Reference-2c69b682c6be45fe8dc7beca9ae5701e)'s a brief guide.
