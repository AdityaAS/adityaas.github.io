I'm a graduate student at Georgia Tech, advised by [Prof. Alexey Tumanov](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~atumanov/) at the Systems for Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL). At Georgia Tech, I work on efficient training of large vision and language models to enable cost effective deployment across diverse scenarios. I also work on robust and efficient representation learning.

In the past, I was a Research Fellow & Machine Learning Scientist at the [Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence](http://wadhwaniai.org/) where I primarily worked on [estimating newborn anthropometry](https://www.wadhwaniai.org/programs/newborn-anthropometry/) using monocular video. I also played a pivotal role in drafing data privacy guidelines, best practices, and helping establish ML infrastructure.

In a previous life, as an undergraduate student at [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), I worked on distributed algorithms, specifically on scaling clustering algorithms to [billion scale data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8891020)

I am honoured to be a young researcher at [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/about-us.html) 2023. My work has previously been featured in [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/03/26/1201/how-artificial-intelligence-is-helping-farmers-and-babies-in-the-developing-world/). My work has also been the recipient of grants from the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) and won [Fast Company's World Changing Idea](https://www.fastcompany.com/90626533/this-ai-powered-tech-calculates-a-babys-weight-just-from-a-video) award in 2021

<font size=2><b>Note</b>: My full legal name is "S... Aditya Sarma, Annavajjala" (Given Name, Last Name). My last name in my undergrad was incorrectly noted as Sarma so my prior publications (2019 and earlier) have my name as "Aditya Sarma". <br>
My preferred name is "Aditya Annavajjala"</font>
