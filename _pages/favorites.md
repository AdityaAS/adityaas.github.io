If you have music, movie, or book recommendations, please drop me an email.

### Music

I've found [NPR TinyDesk](https://www.npr.org/series/tiny-desk-concerts/), [KEXP](https://www.youtube.com/@kexp), [Kappa TV](https://www.youtube.com/@KappaTV_Official) to be great sources to discover new music, and artists.

#### Playlists

- My friend and I maintain [this playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6En3pAxtSOur9BPUfegVWO?si=ec9f79a25ab34b12) pretty regularly
